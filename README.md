## Challenge

The backend needed to handle **real-time updates** for both driver and booking management, including **GPS tracking** and **notifications**. The goal was to design a scalable API that supports **JWT authentication** and secure data management.

---

## Features

### 1. Customers
- **Manage Bookings**: Create, update, and cancel bookings.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Get updates on driver assignments and movements.

### 2. Drivers
- **Receive Booking Requests**: Accept or reject bookings based on availability.
- **Track Bookings**: View and manage active bookings and past history.

### 3. Admins
- **Analytics**: Monitor driver performance and platform activity.
- **Driver & Vehicle Management**: View, update, and manage driver and vehicle data.
- **Booking Management**: Full control over booking creation, modification, and deletion.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js & Express.js**: For handling API requests and routing.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing bookings, users, and driver data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Used for secure access and route protection.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time notifications and driver tracking.
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Implemented for price calculation based on distance, vehicle type, and weight.
